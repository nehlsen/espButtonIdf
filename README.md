# ESP32 IDF Button Component

This is a fork of the button component from https://github.com/espressif/esp-jumpstart

## Why?

I wanted to do similar stuff but just needed the _"Button driver"_.

# Changes

- use IDF 4 style component registration in CMakeLists
- moved Button class to separate header and renamed the class
